### Who controls the price?
### Answer: *The Big Banks*

*   Over 50 % of the **Inter Bank System** is **controlled by** about **4-5 major
    banks**, such as Chase, Citi, HSBC, Deutsche and some Chinese.
*   They **need liquidity** to move the prices, so they eat **spot forex traders**
    for breakfast, lunch *and* dinner.
*   For all currency pairs, **they know** of the collective amount of orders, how
    many are long or short, if they sit above or below price and how big those
    are *(t = 06:30)*. The banks move the prices the **opposite** way of the popular
    positions. An extreme example is the EUR/CHF crash in Jan 2015 *(t =13:30)*.
*   **IG** is a big trading company that **tells where the positions of their traders**
    are. They are a **sample size** big enough to assume that this holds true for the
    rest of the trading world. *(t = 19:30)*. It's called the IG Client Sentiment
    Indicator: <https://www.dailyfx.com/sentiment-report> On their charts you can
    see how the price most of the time moves in the opposite direction of the most
    popular positions. This happens **especially on the USD pairs**, since the USD
    is the most popular traded currency.
*   What we can do, what to avoid *(t = 25:00)*
    * Don't use the same tools everyone else does
      (e.g. [Dirty Dozen](https://youtu.be/3c6o4O8goAo)).
    * Trade more often pairs other than the USD pairs, e.g. GBP/JPY. *(t = 26:20)*
    * Don't trade the news! *(t = 27:50)*

    going. There are good indicators that can tell, but we have to find them!
    VP gives hints in different places, but we've gotta find them on our own.
