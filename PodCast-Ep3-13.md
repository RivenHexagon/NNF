## [Episode 3:](https://nononsenseforex.podbean.com/e/ep3-which-time-frame-gives-you-the-best-results/ "Ep 3 - What time frame to trade in?")
### Which Time Frame Gives You The Best Results?

### Answer: *The daily chart*

 1. **Every technical tool works better and more consistently on the daily chart**
    than on every other time frame. NNF tested this day by day over the years. His
    indicators were always more often right in this time frame. Even weak tools.

 2. **You get your time back.** NNF doesn't spend more than 15 min / day on trading.
    His algorithm tells him: Make, manage or keep a trade. Shorter time frames
    may include a lot of waiting/screen time where the market doesn't even move.

 3. **News events matter a lot less.** Even unsignificant news can kill a trade on
    short time frames. You may be able absorb big news events on a daily scale. A
    news event in a pair's favour could tourn out against you when the banks choose
    to take the opposite position. Or you just keep out of a currency pair that is
    effected by this news. *So keep at least your FX news calendar open.*
 4. **The big banks** employ traders for the purpose to move the market. This fucks
    by far more the 15 min chart traders than the day traders. There are more short
    term traders and they trade all the time.

    NNF trades at 2:00 pm PST.


## [Episode 4:](https://nononsenseforex.podbean.com/e/ep4-how-many-pairs-should-you-trade/ "Ep 4 - How many pairs to trade?")
### How Many Pairs Should You Trade?
### Answer: *All combinations of majors - 1 = 27*

*   It's a big mistake just to trade less or just a few.
*   Take the *eight majors* EUR, GBP, USD, AUD, NZD, CAD, CHF, JPY and trade every
    combination - 1 => 27 pairs
*   Best chances of winning in the majors. NNF usually doesn't trade *exotics*.
*   27 pairs also gives a good chance of entering a few trades at the beginning
    of a trading day, ususaly ending up in 4-5 active trades.
*   Currency pairs do not have their own uniqe movement. Soon or later they all
    move the same, just at a differnet time of the year.
*   **EUR/CHF** is the only currency pair **NNF doesn't trade**. He is a trend
    trader. But this pair has been tied together for a long time.


## [Episode 5:](https://nononsenseforex.podbean.com/e/ep5-how-much-money-do-you-need-to-trade-forex-professionally/ "Ep 5 - How much money to trade?")
### How Much Money Do You Need To Trade Forex Professionally?
### Answer: *Trade the money of others*

*   If you had 100 k in your account, a 20% return over year in FX, gave you 20 k before tax!
*   Alternatively you trade on the behalf of others, provided you're consistently good at FX.
*   Prove can be given even on a demo account over at least a year.
*   Prove to others in realtime that you can keep up under pressure.
