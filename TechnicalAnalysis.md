### Forex Indicators - By Far, The Best Way To Trade (49:17)
*   Indicators are way superior over Price Action
    ([Indicators vs Prica Action](https://youtu.be/QomU7rMSW1o)).
*   Indicators can be **customized**, e.g. default settings tweaked.
*   **Smart** modern **Indicators** were developped over the past 10-15 years.
*   FX is **not Stocks**.
    * Don't use **Stock tools** in FX.
    * Stocks have **supply**, **demand** and **intrinsic** value, FX does **not** (one vs another).
    * Most **common** indicators and PA tools were created for Stocks
*   **Simplifies** indicator **search**:
    * Tools to find **reversals** or top/bottom can be **ruled out**!
    * **Trend indicators** should fall in one of **three categories**
      (see *Trend Indicators* [TA 5](https://youtu.be/YWNloLjXqeI "Trend Indicators - YouTube")).
*   Select the best of the best with a large sample size
*   **Tech Analysis** will **not** make you **win**, it's **Money Managment** and Trading Psychology.

### FX Trend Indicators for the NNF Algorithm (25:14)
*   Catch up: *(t = 2:00)*
    * trade trends, not reversal
    * combine the right indicators
    * trade the daily frame
    * know your risk
*   VP mentions in the [Blog of Podcast Ep9](http://nononsenseforex.com/forex-q-and-a-podcast/are-paid-forex-indicators-worth-it/ "Ep 9 - Blog") where to look for indicators.  
    Or google for *"Forex indicator MT4"*. There are **5-6** good places.  
    Some are not updated anymore, but the infos and indicators are still there.
*   What to look for: *(t = 6:50)*
    * Indie that does **not** get you into a trade **too early**, hence too **many signals**.
    * Indie that does **not** get you into a trade **too late**, hence selective but too **slow**.
    * Avoid whipsaws and false trends. Can be significant at the end of the year. *(t = 7:40)*
    * VP uses **7** out of 50 very good indis. He has mentioned only **six** before. No 7 is used
    **occasionally**, depending the market.
*   **Types** of **trend** confirmation indicators to use: Any indie not one of these types can be
    **dismissed** *(t = 10:35)*.
    * **Zero Line Cross**, below the chart with a zero line. *(t = 11:30)*
    * **Two Line Cross**, below the chart, two dynamic lines crossing. *(t = 16:40)*
        * *Aroon Up&Down* in the top 100, but not part of VPs algo. *(t = 20:00)*
    * **Chart Indicators**, go directly on the candle chart. *(t = 20:40)*
        * *Super-Trend* may work better as an exit than an confirmation editor. Like the
          *Parabolic SAR* they do not work good in a **sideways market**. VP found better entry 
          indis, that **avoid false signals** in those markets.
* Conclusion
    * **Vary** the **default** settings! It may improve the indie a lot. *(t = 15:30)*
    * **Test** on **differnent** currency **pairs**. It may not work on all.


## [TA 7](https://youtu.be/sS52hC1i2hI "MACD - YouTube") / [Blog](https://nononsenseforex.com/indicators/macd-indicator-strategy/ "MACD - Blog")
### MACD Indicator (24:57)
*   Is a **Two Lines Cross** and **Zero Cross** indie.
*   Does **reversals** and **trends**.
*   There are **variations** *(t = 7:40)*
*   * Does it use SMA or EMA to determine the lines?
*   * MT4 has its own MACD
*   * Should I use the **histogram**? *(t = 11:25)*
*   * Variations have been programmed reecently for **FX trading**. *(t = 10:30)*
* Study variations, they may turn out to be usefull 
  ([see blog](https://nononsenseforex.com/indicators/macd-indicator-strategy/ "MACD - Blog")).
  *(t = 11:00)*
* Probably 90 % of traders use it to call **reversals**. *(t = 12:10)*
* VP's **special use** of MACD or **equivalent** indies that do zero & two line cross: *(t = 15:40)*
    * For a **Continuation signal** wait until **both** lines are either **under or above** zero.  
    If under, let them cross **each other** (without crossing zero) and **continue** downward
    or vice versa.
    * VP usually tries to shoot for 100 pips. Meanwhile less, since the market was so slow.
    * VP refers to this as **continuation signals**.
* **Summary** and conclusion: *(t = 21:00)*
    * If both lines **remained** above zero after their last crossing and cross again **upwards**,
      go long and vice versa.
    * Don't use the clasic/standard MACD.
    * Don't use it for reversals or as a zero cross indicator.
    * VP's **most successfull** trades were all **continuation trends**.
