### Forex Indicators - By Far, The Best Way To Trade (49:17)
*   Indicators are way superior over Price Action
    ([Indicators vs Prica Action](https://youtu.be/QomU7rMSW1o)).
*   Indicators can be **customized**, e.g. default settings tweaked.
*   **Smart** modern **Indicators** were developped over the past 10-15 years.
*   FX is **not Stocks**.
    * Don't use **Stock tools** in FX.
    * Stocks have **supply**, **demand** and **intrinsic** value, FX does **not** (one vs another).
    * Most **common** indicators and PA tools were created for Stocks
*   **Simplifies** indicator **search**:
    * Tools to find **reversals** or top/bottom can be **ruled out**!
    * **Trend indicators** should fall in one of **three categories**
      (see *Trend Indicators* [TA 5](https://youtu.be/YWNloLjXqeI "Trend Indicators - YouTube")).
*   Select the best of the best with a large sample size
*   **Tech Analysis** will **not** make you **win**, it's **Money Managment** and Trading Psychology.

### FX Trend Indicators for the NNF Algorithm (25:14)
*   Catch up: *(t = 2:00)*
    * trade trends, not reversal
    * combine the right indicators
    * trade the daily frame
    * know your risk
*   VP mentions in the [Blog of Podcast Ep9](http://nononsenseforex.com/forex-q-and-a-podcast/are-paid-forex-indicators-worth-it/ "Ep 9 - Blog") where to look for indicators.  
    Or google for *"Forex indicator MT4"*. There are **5-6** good places.  
    Some are not updated anymore, but the infos and indicators are still there.
*   What to look for: *(t = 6:50)*
    * Indie that does **not** get you into a trade **too early**, hence too **many signals**.
    * Indie that does **not** get you into a trade **too late**, hence selective but too **slow**.
    * Avoid whipsaws and false trends. Can be significant at the end of the year. *(t = 7:40)*
    * VP uses **7** out of 50 very good indis. He has mentioned only **six** before. No 7 is used
    **occasionally**, depending the market.
*   **Types** of **trend** confirmation indicators to use: Any indie not one of these types can be
    **dismissed** *(t = 10:35)*.
    * **Zero Line Cross**, below the chart with a zero line. *(t = 11:30)*
    * **Two Line Cross**, below the chart, two dynamic lines crossing. *(t = 16:40)*
        * *Aroon Up&Down* in the top 100, but not part of VPs algo. *(t = 20:00)*
    * **Chart Indicators**, go directly on the candle chart. *(t = 20:40)*
        * *Super-Trend* may work better as an exit than an confirmation editor. Like the
          *Parabolic SAR* they do not work good in a **sideways market**. VP found better entry 
          indis, that **avoid false signals** in those markets.
* Conclusion
    * **Vary** the **default** settings! It may improve the indie a lot. *(t = 15:30)*
    * **Test** on **differnent** currency **pairs**. It may not work on all.


## [TA 7](https://youtu.be/sS52hC1i2hI "MACD - YouTube") / [Blog](https://nononsenseforex.com/indicators/macd-indicator-strategy/ "MACD - Blog")
### MACD Indicator (24:57)
*   Is a **Two Lines Cross** and **Zero Cross** indie.
*   Does **reversals** and **trends**.
*   There are **variations** *(t = 7:40)*
*   * Does it use SMA or EMA to determine the lines?
*   * MT4 has its own MACD
*   * Should I use the **histogram**? *(t = 11:25)*
*   * Variations have been programmed reecently for **FX trading**. *(t = 10:30)*
* Study variations, they may turn out to be usefull 
  ([see blog](https://nononsenseforex.com/indicators/macd-indicator-strategy/ "MACD - Blog")).
  *(t = 11:00)*
* Probably 90 % of traders use it to call **reversals**. *(t = 12:10)*
* VP's **special use** of MACD or **equivalent** indies that do zero & two line cross: *(t = 15:40)*
    * For a **Continuation signal** wait until **both** lines are either **under or above** zero.  
    If under, let them cross **each other** (without crossing zero) and **continue** downward
    or vice versa.
    * VP usually tries to shoot for 100 pips. Meanwhile less, since the market was so slow.
    * VP refers to this as **continuation signals**.
* **Summary** and conclusion: *(t = 21:00)*
    * If both lines **remained** above zero after their last crossing and cross again **upwards**,
      go long and vice versa.
    * Don't use the clasic/standard MACD.
    * Don't use it for reversals or as a zero cross indicator.
    * VP's **most successfull** trades were all **continuation trends**.

### Forex Indicator Basics (18:30)
* Read the **ATR correctly**:
    * If we read the ATR right **after** the **close** of a candle, the ATR that is displayed after
      that event, already includes the **new** candle, that hasn't closed yet. The ATR we want is
      the one a tick **before**! Hence, we have to read it directly from the **graph**. *(t = 3:20)*
* Read **indicators correctly** in general:
    * VP trades 20 min **before** the candle closes, which is accurate engough. *(t = 6:00)*
    * In order to **read** an indicator **correctly**, in general, the candle has to **close** first.   
    * Indicators may give buy and sell **signals** throughout the day, but the correct data appears     
      right before or at candle close. *(t = 7:30)*
    * If the lines of a two line cross, sit on each other, **wait** for the next candles to close,
      until they give a **clear** cross signal. *(t = 8:20)*
* Read **charts fast**: *(t = 10:50)*
    * VP monitors **28 pairs**, trades **20 min before** candles **close** and spends **15 min** max
      on trading **FX and metals** per day. *(t = 11:20)*
    * First he takes care of the **trades** he is **currently** in. *(t = 11:30)*
    * Check the **main confirmation** indicator. If it doesn't tell to make a trade, the other indies
      **don't matter**. Move on to the **next chart**. *(t = 12:00)*
    * If it does give a **signal**, look at the **other indicators**. *(t = 12:40)*
* Conclusion: *(t = 16:25)*
    * Wait for the **candle** to **close** or right before.
    * Focus on the **main confirmation** indicator first on all charts to trade **fast**.

### Forex Volume Indicator - Our Oxygen Meter (30:56)
* Algorithm update:
    * ATR
    * ???
    * Confirmation Indi
    * ???
    * **Volume** Indi
    * Exit Indi
* We are trend traders and **volume** makes markets **trend**.
* **Without** volume we make **losses**. We can eliminate those with a good volume indie.
* Part 2 and 4 of the **algorithm** also cut down losses. So **50%** of the algo **reduces losses**.
* A good **volume** indie **does** *(t = 7:20)*
    * tell you if there is **enough** volume to trade.
    * **prevent** you from taking **bad** trades.
    * let **take** you the **good** trades (**needs** also be **tested**).
    * lag as little as possible.
* VP shows **example** of a bad **confirmation** indie. *(t = 11:00)*
* The ROC indi gave 8 loses over 5-6 month on this pair. Just to give an idea of the **time frame**
  and **frequency**. *(t = 13:50)*
* VP then demonstrates how a bad **volume** indi can **fix** some **losses**. *(t = 14:00)*
* We have to **find** a **level** that tells when to **trade** in addition to find the **indi** 
  itself.
* Even the **best** volume indi sometimes **prevents** us from taking **good** trades. But the 
  prevented **losses outnumbers** this.  
  Pieces 2 and 4 of the algo **rarely** skip good trades btw. *(t = 23:50)*
* VP stresses in another **example** how **important** it is to **prevent** entering **loss** trades!
  We have to **test** for **this**. *(t = 20:00)*
* VP asks the followers to give a link to their volume indi source. *(t = 26:20)*
* VP gives a **hint** to an **additional** volume tool. *(t = 28:00)*
* Conclusion:
    * Only trade when the volume is there.
    * Keep adjusting your volume indi and searching for better ones.


## [TA 13](https://youtu.be/N8Kbk0cwIWg "Volume Indicator 2 - YouTube") / - - -
### Volume Indicators Part 2 (22:49)
* **Volume** and **Volatility** are not the same but **related**.
* Volume fosters **volatility, liquidity** and momentum. (VP leaves momentum aside, since momentum
   indis are related to reversals.)
* Since volume and volatility are so closely related, VP doesn't oppose to **search** for
  **both types** of indis but to only **use one** - the most efficient. *(t = 6:30)*
* The **term** volume is **vague**, but **google** defines it as an **individual entity**.
  *(t = 8:30)*
* VP recommends **not** to use **ATR** as a **volume** indicator. **
    * The **reference** line has to be in a **different** place for **every pair**.
    * Markets **change**, so does the **volatility** range **over time**.
    * This makes it highly **inconsitent**.
* VP gives a free **side tool**, he checks on every day, but is **not** part of the **algorithm**.
  *(t = 15:30)*
    * At *barchart.com* **search** for *$EVZ*, click **full chart** and **bookmark**.
    * If the number is **below 8** (changed over time), VP **doesn't** put in the full **2% risk**.
      *(t = 19:00)*
