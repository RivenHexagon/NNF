### Forex Indicators - By Far, The Best Way To Trade (49:17)
*   Indicators are way superior over Price Action
    ([Indicators vs Prica Action](https://youtu.be/QomU7rMSW1o)).
*   Indicators can be **customized**, e.g. default settings tweaked.
*   **Smart** modern **Indicators** were developped over the past 10-15 years.
*   FX is **not Stocks**.
    * Don't use **Stock tools** in FX.
    * Stocks have **supply**, **demand** and **intrinsic** value, FX does **not** (one vs another).
    * Most **common** indicators and PA tools were created for Stocks
*   **Simplifies** indicator **search**:
    * Tools to find **reversals** or top/bottom can be **ruled out**!
    * **Trend indicators** should fall in one of **three categories**
      (see *Trend Indicators* [TA 5](https://youtu.be/YWNloLjXqeI "Trend Indicators - YouTube")).
*   Select the best of the best with a large sample size
*   **Tech Analysis** will **not** make you **win**, it's **Money Managment** and Trading Psychology.

### FX Trend Indicators for the NNF Algorithm (25:14)
*   Catch up: *(t = 2:00)*
    * trade trends, not reversal
    * combine the right indicators
    * trade the daily frame
    * know your risk
*   VP mentions in the [Blog of Podcast Ep9](http://nononsenseforex.com/forex-q-and-a-podcast/are-paid-forex-indicators-worth-it/ "Ep 9 - Blog") where to look for indicators.  
    Or google for *"Forex indicator MT4"*. There are **5-6** good places.  
    Some are not updated anymore, but the infos and indicators are still there.
*   What to look for: *(t = 6:50)*
    * Indie that does **not** get you into a trade **too early**, hence too **many signals**.
    * Indie that does **not** get you into a trade **too late**, hence selective but too **slow**.
    * Avoid whipsaws and false trends. Can be significant at the end of the year. *(t = 7:40)*
    * VP uses **7** out of 50 very good indis. He has mentioned only **six** before. No 7 is used
    **occasionally**, depending the market.
*   **Types** of **trend** confirmation indicators to use: Any indie not one of these types can be
    **dismissed** *(t = 10:35)*.
    * **Zero Line Cross**, below the chart with a zero line. *(t = 11:30)*
    * **Two Line Cross**, below the chart, two dynamic lines crossing. *(t = 16:40)*
        * *Aroon Up&Down* in the top 100, but not part of VPs algo. *(t = 20:00)*
    * **Chart Indicators**, go directly on the candle chart. *(t = 20:40)*
        * *Super-Trend* may work better as an exit than an confirmation editor. Like the
          *Parabolic SAR* they do not work good in a **sideways market**. VP found better entry 
          indis, that **avoid false signals** in those markets.
* Conclusion
    * **Vary** the **default** settings! It may improve the indie a lot. *(t = 15:30)*
    * **Test** on **differnent** currency **pairs**. It may not work on all.


## [TA 7](https://youtu.be/sS52hC1i2hI "MACD - YouTube") / [Blog](https://nononsenseforex.com/indicators/macd-indicator-strategy/ "MACD - Blog")
### MACD Indicator (24:57)
*   Is a **Two Lines Cross** and **Zero Cross** indie.
*   Does **reversals** and **trends**.
*   There are **variations** *(t = 7:40)*
    * Does it use SMA or EMA to determine the lines?
    * MT4 has its own MACD
    * Ignore the **histogram** *(t = 11:25)*
    * Use a variation that actually plots **two lines**.
    * Variations have been programmed reecently for **FX trading**. *(t = 10:30)*
    * *Blog:* It originates from the 70s for **stock trading**.
* Study variations, they may turn out to be usefull 
  ([see blog](https://nononsenseforex.com/indicators/macd-indicator-strategy/ "MACD - Blog")).
  *(t = 11:00)*
* Probably 90 % of traders use it to call **reversals**. *(t = 12:10)*
* *Blog:* In the Trend Indicator [Video](https://youtu.be/YWNloLjXqeI "Trend Indicators - YouTube") 
  VP talkes about **zero-cross** and **two lines cross** as trend conformation.  
  MACD **combines both**, so do **similar** indicators like it.
* VP's **special use** of MACD or ***equivalent*** zero + two line cross indies: *(t = 15:40)*
    * For a **Continuation signal** wait until **both** lines are either **under or above** zero.  
    If under, let them cross **each other** (without crossing zero) and **continue** downward
    or vice versa.
    * VP usually tries to shoot for 100 pips. Meanwhile less, since the market was so slow.
    * VP refers to this as **continuation signals**.
* **Summary** and conclusion: *(t = 21:00)*
    * If both lines **remained** above zero after their last crossing and cross again **upwards**,
      go long and vice versa.
    * Don't use the clasic/standard MACD.
    * Don't use it for reversals or as a zero cross indicator.
    * VP's **most successfull** trades were all **continuation trends**.
* ***Open question***: How does it fit the **algorithm**?

### Forex Indicator Basics (18:30)
* Read the **ATR correctly**:
    * If we read the ATR right **after** the **close** of a candle, the ATR that is displayed after
      that event, already includes the **new** candle, that hasn't closed yet. The ATR we want is
      the one a tick **before**! Hence, we have to read it directly from the **graph**. *(t = 3:20)*
* Read **indicators correctly** in general:
    * VP trades 20 min **before** the candle closes, which is accurate engough. *(t = 6:00)*
    * In order to **read** an indicator **correctly**, in general, the candle has to **close** first.   
    * Indicators may give buy and sell **signals** throughout the day, but the correct data appears     
      right before or at candle close. *(t = 7:30)*
    * If the lines of a two line cross, sit on each other, **wait** for the next candles to close,
      until they give a **clear** cross signal. *(t = 8:20)*
* Read **charts fast**: *(t = 10:50)*
    * VP monitors **28 pairs**, trades **20 min before** candles **close** and spends **15 min** max
      on trading **FX and metals** per day. *(t = 11:20)*
    * First he takes care of the **trades** he is **currently** in. *(t = 11:30)*
    * Check the **main confirmation** indicator. If it doesn't tell to make a trade, the other indies
      **don't matter**. Move on to the **next chart**. *(t = 12:00)*
    * If it does give a **signal**, look at the **other indicators**. *(t = 12:40)*
* Conclusion: *(t = 16:25)*
    * Wait for the **candle** to **close** or right before.
    * Focus on the **main confirmation** indicator first on all charts to trade **fast**.

## [TA 12](https://youtu.be/NWqbmPC3bD8 "Volume Indicator - YouTube") / [Blog](https://nononsenseforex.com/indicators/forex-volume/ "Volume Indicator - Blog")
### Forex Volume Indicator - Our Oxygen Meter (30:56)
* Algorithm update:
    * ATR
    * ???
    * Confirmation Indi
    * ???
    * **Volume** Indi
    * Exit Indi
* We are trend traders and **volume** makes markets **trend**.
* **Without** volume we make **losses**. We can eliminate those with a good volume indie.
* Part 2 and 4 of the **algorithm** also cut down losses the **confirmation** indi would give.
  So **50%** of the algo **reduces losses**.
* A good **volume** indie **does** *(t = 7:20)*
    * tell you if there is **enough** volume to trade.
    * **prevent** you from taking **bad trades**.
    * let **take** you the **good trades** (needs also be **tested**).
    * lag as little as possible.
* VP shows an **example** of a bad **confirmation** indie. *(t = 11:00)*
* The ROC indi gave 8 loses over 5-6 month on this pair. Just to give an idea of the **time frame**
  and **frequency**. *(t = 13:50)*
* VP then demonstrates how a bad **volume** indi can **fix** some **losses**. *(t = 14:00)*
* We have to **find** a **level** that tells when to **trade** in addition to find the **indi** 
  itself.
* Even the **best** volume indi sometimes **prevents** us from taking **good** trades. But the 
  prevented **losses outnumbers** this.  
  Pieces 2 and 4 of the algo **rarely** skip good trades btw. *(t = 23:50)*
* VP stresses in another **example** how **important** it is to **prevent** entering **loss trades**!
  We have to **test** for **this**. *(t = 20:00)*
* VP asks the followers to give a link to their volume indi source. *(t = 26:20)*
* VP gives a **hint** to an **additional** volume tool. *(t = 28:00)*
* Conclusion:
    * Only trade when the volume is there.
    * Keep adjusting your volume indi and the search for better ones.
* *Blog:* To **test** a **volume** indi:
    * take the **win/loss** data from the **confirmation** indi
    * delete any wins and losses the volume indi prevented.
    * **Compare** the recorded **differences** for every indi tested.
    * **Tweak** the **settings**.


## [TA 13](https://youtu.be/N8Kbk0cwIWg "Volume Indicator 2 - YouTube") / - - -
### Volume Indicators Part 2 (22:49)
* **Volume** and **Volatility** are not the same but **related**.
* Volume fosters **volatility, liquidity** and momentum. (VP leaves momentum aside, since momentum
   indis are related to reversals.)
* Since volume and volatility are so closely related, VP doesn't oppose to **search** for
  **both types** of indis but to only **use one**. *(t = 6:30)*
* The **term** volume is **vague**, but **google** defines it as an **individual entity**.
  *(t = 8:30)*
* VP recommends **not** to use **ATR** as a **volume** indicator.
    * The **reference** line has to be in a **different** place for **every pair**.
    * Markets **change**, so does the **volatility** range **over time**.
    * This makes the **placement** of the **line** highly **inconsitent**.
* VP gives a free **side tool** he checks on every day, but is **not** part of the **algorithm**.
  *(t = 15:30)*
    * At *barchart.com* **search** for *$EVZ*, **click** *full chart* and **bookmark**.
    * If the number is **below 8** (changed over time), VP **doesn't** put in the full **2% risk**.
      *(t = 19:00)*

### Faster Ways To Test Forex Indicators (12:14)
* *Blog:* Most indis VP **uses** he **didn't** like on **first glance**.
* **Rule out** at an early stage **indis** that:
    * **just** follow **price**.
    * **don't** even **work** in the **example** (screen shot).
    * give too **many** buy and sell **signals** quickly after each other (typically losses).
    * shows **support** and **resistance** lines. *Blog:* Includes words *pivot, gann, channel*, etc.
    * you can't **modify**.


## [TA 18](https://youtu.be/IxZ1EdqFJcM "MA on Indicators - YouTube") / - - -
### Putting A Moving Average on an Indicator Makes Things Happen (19:57)
* Indis that seem **useless** at first glance, may turn out **usefull** if combined with a **moving
  average**.
* VP shows an example on the chart. *(t = 5:20)*
    * In the menu go to *trend*, not oscillators, and choose *MA*.
    * *Drag* it down on the indicator under test.
    * In the pop-up window from the *Apply to* drop-down menu, choose *First Indocator's Data*.
* **Turned** indi under test into a **two-line cross** that gave usefull short signals. *(t = 6:40)*
* Example with a **zero cross** indi and turns it into a **continuation** trade indi. *(t = 12:00)*
* **Continuation** trades are **not part** of the **algorithm**, but an **add-on**. *(t = 13:10)*
* Example **with** a volume indi (ADx). *(t = 14:00)*


## [TA 20](https://youtu.be/JxUtee7krFc "Algorithm Part 5 - YouTube") / - - -
### My Forex Algorithm - Part 5 Revealed (23:59)
* Algorithm update:
    * ATR
    * ???
    * 1st Confirmation Indi
    * **2nd Confirmation** Indi
    * Volume Indi
    * Exit Indi
* Have two confirmation indis of **different types** out of the three categories *zero-cross*,
  *two lines cross* and *chart indicator* .
* **Together** they have to play well. **Test** them in **combination**.
* The **1st confirmation** indie makes **all** the **decisions** for **entry**.
* **Then** consult the **2nd confirmation** indi for green or red light.
* Find out which 2nd indi **takes** away the most **losses** while **preserving** the **wins**.
* Chart **example** on a representative *EUR/USD* section **(Aug 2018 - Feb 2019)**. *(t = 14:00)*


## [TA 25](https://youtu.be/1b3D1gNUyiw "Exit Indicators - YouTube") / - - -
### Exit Indicators - Worth A Lot More Than You Think (24:03)
* An exit indicator gets you **out** of a:
    * **winning** trade  **before** it hits the **trailing stop**. *(t = 3:00)*
    * **losing** trade **before** it hits the **stop loss**. *(t = 4:40)*
    * **stagnating** trade that has lost its momentum. *(t = 6:00)*
* After scale out it **exits** a **winning** trade close to the top/botton of a long/short trade.
* The **trailing** stop **protects** you from an **extreme** short/long candle. Same holds true for
  the **stop loss**.  
  But the indicator **exits** at a more **optimal** time.
* **Rules** for **finding/using** one: *(t = 6:30)*
    * Could be the **same** as the **confirmation** indicator. (Was the case for VP).
    * If not, it only goes on chart **after** entering a trade.
    * **Two-lines cross** recommended. **Test** for entry **and** exit capabilities.
    * **Heikin Ashi** can be used, such as the **Vigor Index**.
    * In search for a **better** one, it has to **beat those** two. **Only** then **tweak** settings.
* VP shows chart **example** with *Vigor Index. (t = 14:40)*

### Backtesting (Confirmation) Indicators (15:41)
* *Q:* What is the most effective way to test confirmation and exit indis?
* The answer is based on an **early stage** where only **ATR, confirmation and exit** indi are 
  revealed, including **risk management** and **scaling out**.
* *Blog:* Three questions to answer before:
    * How many currency pairs to test this on?
    * Are you modifying the default settings and how many times?
    * How far back are you gonna test?
* *A:* VP **focuses** on testing the **confirmation** indi. *(t = 6:00)*
    * Pic a currencey pair and put the indi up on the chart with the **default settings** first.
    * Put the ATR underneith.
    * Go **back** 2 - 3 years **max**, since **market** was completely **different** further back.  
      *Blog:* An excellent confirmation indi gives you signals when the market is right for it, and
      avoids signals when it’s not.
    * Start from the present and go **back in time** until the **first** buy/sell **signal**.
    * *Blog:* Figure loss or win:
        * Find the **ATR** at **time of entry** (buy/sell signal).
        * Figure what **event** happened **first**:  
          did price hit the *1.0 x ATR* value as a **win** or  
          did price hit the *1.5 x ATR* in the **opposite** direction as a **loss**?
    * For e.g. **ATR** was 80 pips at **time of entry**. If you made 80 pips **before** you
      **lost** 120 pips *(1.5 x ATR)*, it was a **win**. *(t = 8:10)*
    * *Blog:* Just **move on** in cases where the indicator gives a signal to go opposite **before** 
      price became **win or loss**.
    * Record win/loss while going backwards in time. It gives a **win/loss record** for this indi.  
      *Blog:* For every currency **pair** have a **separate** spread **sheet** that contains:
      *Indicator | Settings | win | lose | win %*
    * Make a **percentage** of it. 10 wins and 5 losses yield a **66 % win** percentage. *(t = 8:50)*
    * Repeat this for all indis and make a **ranking**. Go forward with the **2-3 best** ones.
    * *Blog:* VP can test about **5 indis** in roughly **30 min** by hand.
