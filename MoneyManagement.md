### Money Management is the most important thing in FX

*   **Money Managemant** makes your trading **account** go **up** or **down**.
*   If you enter a trade by **flipping a coin** and your **MM is right**, you still
    **make money** in the long turn.
*   **The Big 3** in order of importance:
    * Money Management
    * Trading Psychology
    * Trade Entries
*   **MM is** about *(t = 5:00)*
    * What to **risk** (% of account)
    * How many **pips** to risk
    * Managing a trade
    * Indicatros involved

### ATR Is The World’s Best Forex Indicator
Technical details at Investopedia: <https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atr.asp>

*   There are over **10'000** indicators. **ATR** is the **most important** of all.
*   **Average True Range** gives the **volatility** of a currency pair.
*   It tells how many **pips** a pair has moved, on **average**, over the **past 14 candles**.
    *(t = 7:20)*
*   VP **always** uses it **to determine** how much to **risk**. Hence, the **ATR** is most important
    for **money management**.
*   VP **doesn't** describe **trade** entry **volumes** in **units** or **dollars**. He goes in
    ***pips!*** *(t = 7:50)*
*   **Example:** One **lot** on the EUR/USD = $10 **per pip**, which is the **pip value**.
*   **Measure** the ATR *during the week* at the **end** of a **trading day** - about
    20 to 30 min **before** the *daily* chart **candle closes**. After **closing**, it will
    **thorw off** the **equation**. *(t = 9:30), (t = 10:50)*
*   *Blog:* Hence, VP **enters** trades **shortly before the end** of the trading day, after
    reading the ATR.
*   **Ignore** the ATR plot **line**, just **focus** on the current **value**, in the corner.
    (On *USD/JPY* 0.6570 means 65 pips, 1.13 are 113 pips!)
*   Typically ***EUR/GBP*** is the **slowest** *major* pair, ***GBP/NZD*** is the **fastest**.
    *(t = 11:30)*
*   If *GBP/NZD* moves **3x faster** than the *EUR/GBP* and you trade *EUR/GBP* at *$6/pip*, you just
    **trade** *pound/kiwi* a **third less**, *$2/pip*. *(t = 12:20)*
*   That's how the **ATR manages** your **risk**. *(t = 13:10)*
*   With the ATR you can **trade** basically **any pair** with ease. *(t = 14:10)*

### Risk Management - A structure to follow
*   If a $50 k account goes **10 k down** to $40 k, it needs a **25 %** return to **break even!**
*   **Risk 2%** of your entire trading **account** on **every** trade.  It's the most you can lose
    on a trade. *(t = 9:10)*
*   It doesn't mean you always lose the full 2%. Only if it **hits** your **stop-loss**
    indicating the 2%. *(t = 9:30)*
*   Starts explaining the structure *(t = 10:30)*
    * **Stop loss** should be *1.5 x ATR* away **from** where the **price** of a pair is **now**.<br>
    If ATR is 80 pips, the Stop Loss sould be 120 pips away, when you **first enter** a trade.
    *(t = 12:00)*
    * The actual **value** of a **pip** *Vp* in USD or EUR is: *Vp = R / (1.5 * ATR).* Where *R* is
    the risk in USD or EUR. *(t = 13:00)*<br>
    For e.g. 2% of a 50'000 € trading account is as risk of R = 1'000 €.
*   **VP shows** an **example** on a **demo account**, doing the **math by hand**. *(t = 14:20)*
*   Algorithm system revealed so far: *(t = 21:40)*
*   1. ATR
    2. -- not yet provided --
    3. Conformation indicator
    4. -- not yet provided --
    5. -- not yet provided --
    6. Exit indicator
*   Usually your **exit indicator** gets you **out** of a bad trade **before** it hits the
    **stop loss**. Sometimes a **conformation indicator** can do this, but sometimes you **find one
    better** suited for that purpose. *(t = 22:10)*
*   A good **exit indicator** gives your trade enough **breating room**, but avoids **stop loss.**
    *(t = 22:30)*
*   Check out **Blog** for **Podcast Ep9** to know a place where to **find good** under-the-radar
    **indicators**. *(t = 23:20)*
*   **Warning:** You can have as **many trades** of different pairs open as you wish, but **DO NOT**
    trade the **same** currency more than **once** at 2% risk! For e.g. *EUR/USD* short, *AUD/USD*
    short and *USD/JPY* long. This would put **6%** of your accout at risk on the USD! *(t = 24:50)*
*   **Alternatively** you just choose **one pair** only **or** you go **half** the risk on **two**
    trades involving the **same** currency. *(t = 26:40)*
*   *Blog:* VP prefers **option one** and gives a more **precise approach**: If the choice is for
    e.g. between going long *AUD/USD* and *AUD/CAD*. Look at **other** *USD* and *CAD* **pairs**
    and see how they do, to make your **choice**. This way you have a **solid approach**.

## [MM 6](https://youtu.be/tw_w-TfhCNM "Risk Ratios - YouTube") / [Blog](https://nononsenseforex.com/trade-management/risk-reward-ratios/ "Risk Ratios - Blog")
### Risk Reward Ratios - Should You Use Them?
*   VP's short answer: **Don't** ever use **Risk to Revard Ratios** such as *R=2:1* or *R=3:1*!
*   This means you **take profit** at *TP = R x SL*, where *R* is the R2R Ratio (2 or 3) and *SL*
    is your **stop loss**. *(t = 5:30)*
*   For e.g. if *SL = 80 pips*, with *R = 2*, you either **win 160** pips **or** you **lose 80** pips.
    There is **no in between**!
*   *Blog:* It’s a **winner-take-all** method. Either you **win big** or **lose medium** (binary
    options). The probability of a win is even less than 33% with a 2:1 ratio.
*   Common **mistake** is to find a **support line**, figure the **take profit first** and the
    **stop loss depending** on the **ratio**. If the trade goes in your favour, you take profit.
    But if the price moves even further, the **door** is already **closed** for every
    **additional profit**! *(t = 8:00)*
*   This are **three mistakes** in one:
    * Using a **Dirty Dozen** tool to determine TP. *(t = 11:40)*
    * Not **scaling out**, by not using a **trailing SL**, in order to **ensure break-even**.
    *(t = 12:50)*
    * **Capping wins** beyond TP. Instead **keep** for e.g. 50 % of **profit in** the game -
    the actual meaning of scaling out. *(t = 15:10)*
*   **Conclusion:** By ensuring break-even, the small wins **cancel out** your **losses**.
    The **wins beyond** break-even are your **final profits** at the end of the year! *(t = 16:30)*
*   VP is giving a **demonstration** using the **Aroon Up & Down** indicator. *(t = 17:40)*
*   See video [MM 9](https://youtu.be/tJBmVhefMeE "Trade Management - YouTube") on Scaling Out.
*   *Blog:* **Preventing** a **loss** is like a **win** (against other losses). And **R2Rs generate**
    a lot of **losses**.

### Exit Indicators and Time - <br> How long do you hold on to your trades?
### Answer: *Until the trend is over.*
*   It can include the **weekend**. One of his trades went over a **month**. Don't cap the **upside**.
*   VP's trades typically end in one of **three ways**:
    * It hits the **break-even** stop loss.
    * It hits the **trailing** stop loss.
    * By notification of the **exit indicator**.
*   **Time** is no factor.
*   About the exit indicator: *(t = 10:00)*
    * Typically **not** a **zero cross**.
    * Must not be too tight, in order to **allow** the **big trends** and wins.
    * Must get you **out**, more often than not, **before** price hits the **trailing stop**.
