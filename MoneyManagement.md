### The ATR Is The Worldâ€™s Best Forex Indicator
Technical details at Investopedia: <https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atr.asp>

*   There are over **10'000** indicators. **ATR** is the **most important** of all.
*   **Average True Range** gives the **volatility** of a currency pair.
*   It tells how many **pips** a pair has moved, on **average**, over the **past 14 candles**.
    *(t = 7:20)*
*   VP **always** uses it **to determine** how much to **risk**. Hence, the **ATR** is most important
    for **money management**.
*   VP **doesn't** describe **trade** entry **volumes** in **units** or **dollars**. He goes in
    ***pips!*** *(t = 7:50)*
*   **Example:** One **lot** on the EUR/USD = $10 **per pip**, which is the **pip value**.
*   **Measure** the ATR *during the week* at the **end** of a **trading day** - about
    20 to 30 min **before** the *daily* chart **candle closes**. After closing, it will **thorw off**
    the **equation**. *(t = 9:30), (t = 10:50)*
*   *BlogSup:* Hence, VP **enters** trades **shortly before the end** of the trading day, after
    reading the ATR.
*   **Ignore** the ATR plot **line**, just **focus** on the current **value**, in the corner.
    (On *USD/JPY* 0.6570 means 65 pips, 1.13 are 113 pips!)
*   Typically ***EUR/GBP*** is the **slowest** *major* pair, ***GBP/NZD*** is the **fastest**.
    *(t = 11:30)*
*   If *GBP/NZD* moves **3x faster** than the *EUR/GBP* and you trade *EUR/GBP* at *$6/pip*, you just
    **trade** *pound/kiwi* a **third less**, *$2/pip*. *(t = 12:20)*
*   That's how the **ATR manages** your **risk**. *(t = 13:10)*
*   With the ATR you can **trade** basically **any pair** with ease. *(t = 14:10)*
