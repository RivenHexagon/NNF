    many are long or short, if they sit above or below price and how big those
    are *(t = 06:30)*. The banks move the prices the **opposite** way of the popular
    positions. An extreme example is the EUR/CHF crash in Jan 2015 *(t =13:30)*.

    rest of the trading world. *(t = 19:30)*. It's called the IG Client Sentiment

    * Don't trade the news! *(t = 27:50)*
