### Money Management is the most important thing in FX

*   **Money Managemant** makes your trading **account** go **up** or **down**.
*   If you enter a trade by **flipping a coin** and your **MM is right**, you still
    **make money** in the long turn.
*   **The Big 3** in order of importance:
    * Money Management
    * Trading Psychology
    * Trade Entries
*   **MM is** about *(t = 5:00)*
    * What to **risk** (% of account)
    * How many **pips** to risk
    * Managing a trade
    * Indicatros involved

### ATR Is The World’s Best Forex Indicator
Technical details at Investopedia: <https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atr.asp>

*   There are over **10'000** indicators. **ATR** is the **most important** of all.
*   **Average True Range** gives the **volatility** of a currency pair.
*   It tells how many **pips** a pair has moved, on **average**, over the **past 14 candles**.
    *(t = 7:20)*
*   VP **always** uses it **to determine** how much to **risk**. Hence, the **ATR** is most important
    for **money management**.
*   VP **doesn't** describe **trade** entry **volumes** in **units** or **dollars**. He goes in
    ***pips!*** *(t = 7:50)*
*   **Example:** One **lot** on the EUR/USD = $10 **per pip**, which is the **pip value**.
*   **Measure** the ATR *during the week* at the **end** of a **trading day** - about
    20 to 30 min **before** the *daily* chart **candle closes**. After **closing**, it will
    **thorw off** the **equation**. *(t = 9:30), (t = 10:50)*
*   *Blog:* Hence, VP **enters** trades **shortly before the end** of the trading day, after
    reading the ATR.
*   **Ignore** the ATR plot **line**, just **focus** on the current **value**, in the corner.
    (On *USD/JPY* 0.6570 means 65 pips, 1.13 are 113 pips!)
*   Typically ***EUR/GBP*** is the **slowest** *major* pair, ***GBP/NZD*** is the **fastest**.
    *(t = 11:30)*
*   If *GBP/NZD* moves **3x faster** than the *EUR/GBP* and you trade *EUR/GBP* at *$6/pip*, you just
    **trade** *pound/kiwi* a **third less**, *$2/pip*. *(t = 12:20)*
*   That's how the **ATR manages** your **risk**. *(t = 13:10)*
*   With the ATR you can **trade** basically **any pair** with ease. *(t = 14:10)*

### Risk Management - A structure to follow
*   If a $50 k account goes **10 k down** to $40 k, it needs a **25 %** return to **break even!**
*   **Risk 2%** of your entire trading **account** on **every** trade.  It's the most you can lose
    on a trade. *(t = 9:10)*
*   It doesn't mean you always lose the full 2%. Only if it **hits** your **stop-loss**
    indicating the 2%. *(t = 9:30)*
*   Starts explaining the structure *(t = 10:30)*
    * **Stop loss** should be *1.5 x ATR* away **from** where the **price** of a pair is **now**.<br>
    If ATR is 80 pips, the Stop Loss sould be 120 pips away, when you **first enter** a trade.
    *(t = 12:00)*
    * The actual **value** of a **pip** *Vp* in USD or EUR is: *Vp = R / (1.5 * ATR).* Where *R* is
    the risk in USD or EUR. *(t = 13:00)*<br>
    For e.g. 2% of a 50'000 € trading account is as risk of R = 1'000 €.
*   **VP shows** an **example** on a **demo account**, doing the **math by hand**. *(t = 14:20)*
*   Algorithm system revealed so far: *(t = 21:40)*
*   1. ATR
    2. ???
    3. Conformation indicator
    4. ???
    5. ???
    6. Exit indicator
*   Usually your **exit indicator** gets you **out** of a bad trade **before** it hits the
    **stop loss**. Sometimes a **conformation indicator** can do this, but sometimes you **find one
    better** suited for that purpose. *(t = 22:10)*
*   A good **exit indicator** gives your trade enough **breating room**, but avoids **stop loss.**
    *(t = 22:30)*
*   Check out **Blog** for **Podcast Ep9** to know a place where to **find good** under-the-radar
    **indicators**. *(t = 23:20)*
*   **Warning:** You can have as **many trades** of different pairs open as you wish, but **DO NOT**
    trade the **same** currency more than **once** at 2% risk! For e.g. *EUR/USD* short, *AUD/USD*
    short and *USD/JPY* long. This would put **6%** of your accout at risk on the USD! *(t = 24:50)*
*   **Alternatively** you just choose **one pair** only **or** you go **half** the risk on **two**
    trades involving the **same** currency. *(t = 26:40)*
*   *Blog:* VP prefers **option one** and gives a more **precise approach**: If the choice is for
    e.g. between going long *AUD/USD* and *AUD/CAD*. Look at **other** *USD* and *CAD* **pairs**
    and see how they do, to make your **choice**. This way you have a **solid approach**.

## [MM 6](https://youtu.be/tw_w-TfhCNM "Risk Ratios - YouTube") / [Blog](https://nononsenseforex.com/trade-management/risk-reward-ratios/ "Risk Ratios - Blog")
### Risk Reward Ratios - Should You Use Them?
*   VP's short answer: **Don't** ever use **Risk to Revard Ratios** such as *R=2:1* or *R=3:1*!
*   This means you **take profit** at *TP = R x SL*, where *R* is the R2R Ratio (2 or 3) and *SL*
    is your **stop loss**. *(t = 5:30)*
*   For e.g. if *SL = 80 pips*, with *R = 2*, you either **win 160** pips **or** you **lose 80** pips.
    There is **no in between**!
*   *Blog:* It’s a **winner-take-all** method. Either you **win big** or **lose medium** (binary
    options). The probability of a win is even less than 33% with a 2:1 ratio.
*   Common **mistake** is to find a **support line**, figure the **take profit first** and the
    **stop loss depending** on the **ratio**. If the trade goes in your favour, you take profit.
    But if the price moves even further, the **door** is already **closed** for every
    **additional profit**! *(t = 8:00)*
*   This are **three mistakes** in one:
    * Using a **Dirty Dozen** tool to determine TP. *(t = 11:40)*
    * Not **scaling out**, by not using a **trailing SL**, in order to **ensure break-even**.
    *(t = 12:50)*
    * **Capping wins** beyond TP. Instead **keep** for e.g. 50 % of **profit in** the game -
    the actual meaning of scaling out. *(t = 15:10)*
*   **Conclusion:** By ensuring break-even, the small wins **cancel out** your **losses**.
    The **wins beyond** break-even are your **final profits** at the end of the year! *(t = 16:30)*
*   VP is giving a **demonstration** using the **Aroon Up & Down** indicator. *(t = 17:40)*
*   See video [MM 9](https://youtu.be/tJBmVhefMeE "Trade Management - YouTube") on Scaling Out.
*   *Blog:* **Preventing** a **loss** is like a **win** (against other losses). And **R2Rs generate**
    a lot of **losses**.


## [MM 7 (Podcast Ep 18)](https://nononsenseforex.podbean.com/e/ep18-exit-indicators-and-time/ "Ep 18 - Exit Indicators") / - - -
### Exit Indicators and Time - <br> How long do you hold on to your trades?
### Answer: *Until the trend is over.*
*   It can include the **weekend**. One of his trades went over a **month**. Don't cap the **upside**.
*   VP's trades typically end in one of **three ways**:
    * It hits the **break-even** stop loss.
    * It hits the **trailing** stop loss.
    * By notification of the **exit indicator**.
*   **Time** is no factor.
*   About the exit indicator: *(t = 10:00)*
    * Typically **not** a **zero cross**.
    * Must not be too tight, in order to **allow** the **big trends** and wins.
    * Must get you **out**, more often than not, **before** price hits the **trailing stop**.

### Trade Management - Scale Out!
*   Next **step after** calculationg the **risk**.
*   Have **loss limits**, but also have **win limits** too! **Take out** money at some point is the
    big take away of this episode. You have **nothing until** you **sell**!
*   VP uses the **ATR** to **evaluate** his win limits in a **simplified** way. He **tested**
    it and got the **same results** as in a complicated alternative. *(t = 8:50)*
*   How to **enter** a trade
    *   Figure your **risk** *(t = 9:50)*
    *   Take **half** that risk (amount per pip)
    *   Enter **two** trades with the **same stop loss** and **half risk**. (workaround if broker
        doesn't support scale-out.) *(t = 11:00)*
        * One trade has the *initial* **take profit** at the **ATR** (e.g. TP = 80 pips).
          This will **close** the **trade** automatically when it gets there and esures **break-even**.
        * If price hits **take profit** point, **move stop loss** of the **remaining** trade to break-
          even (where you entered your trade). *(t = 21:40)*
        * Let it run until the trend is over. It takes the **big wins**.
*   VP gives an **example** on an actual *NZD/CHF* long trade. *(t = 12:20)*
*   **VP** mentiones he has been between **20 % - 30 % pa** in FX (by 2018). *(t = 16:30)*
*   After entering your trade, **don't look** at it. Let it **run**, so you don't get **emotional**.
    *(t = 20:30)*
*   Put in trailing stops ([MM 13](https://youtu.be/Bsc_1GwKINM "Trailing Stops - YouTube")).

## [MM 10 (Podcast Ep 20)](https://nononsenseforex.podbean.com/e/ep20-monthly-returns-whats-good/ "Ep 20 - Monthly Returns") / [Blog](https://nononsenseforex.com/forex-q-and-a-podcast/monthly-returns-in-forex/ "Ep 20 - Blog")
### Monthly Returns in Forex - What’s Good?
### Answer: *Don't set monthly profit targets - it's self sabotage.*
*   Look at **percentage** returns, not **pips**.
    *   Pips have a different **value** depending on the risk.
    *   A return in **pips** always needs to be seen in **relation** to the **ATR** of a pair.
*   Return per month can **fluctuate** a lot. There gonna be **month** with **losses**! It is very
    **inconsistent**. *(t = 7:50)*
*   Don't take **trades** you should't just because of **temporary** lacking returns.
*   FX gives the luxury of **not taking** trades if there are no. We let the market come to us.
    *(t = 8:10)*
*   Have **patience**! The **market** is never the same **month-to-month**. *(t = 9:00)*
*   For **testing** the **indicators** you need **longer** terms! *(t = 10:25)*
*   A **6 to 12** month period gives a much **better** picture.
*   *Blog:* VP hits 20 % - 30 % pa targets by **not trying** to hit those targets!


## [MM 11 (Podcast Ep 25)](https://nononsenseforex.podbean.com/e/ep25-adding-to-a-winning-trade/ "Ep 25 - Adding On") / [Blog](https://nononsenseforex.com/forex-q-and-a-podcast/scaling-in/ "Ep 25 - Blog")
### Adding to a Winning Trade?
### Answer: *No*
*   In opposition to **scaling out**
    ([MM 9](https://youtu.be/tJBmVhefMeE "Trade Management - YouTube")),
    you could also **scale in**, for e.g. buy a dip when a retreat happens while the trade runs.
*   The **entry indicator** gave you the **optimal time** to enter a trade. **How** would you
    **know** if a winning trade **continues** to win or will again turn in your favour? *(t = 5:45)*
*   In *Podcast Ep 23*, VP mentions the **FOMO** (fear of missing out) trade. He took **losses**,
    cuz those trends are mathematically **against** us, the **more** they already moved in our
    favour! *(t = 6:50)*
*   What if we are in a **winning** trade and the **algorithm** gives **another** signal to enter?
    In order for the confirmation indicator to give **second signal**, it would have first to have
    gone the **other way**. Hence, it would have already told you to **get out**! *(t = 9:15)*
*   *Blog:* If your **confirmation indicator** gives you an exit signal **before** the
    **exit indicator** does, the exit indicator **sucks**.
*   *Blog:* You could have **scaled in** or **exited and entered** again. The second option follows
    a **system** and puts the **odds** in your favour!

## [MM 12 (Podcast Ep 40)](https://nononsenseforex.podbean.com/e/ep40-dollar-cost-averaging-and-martingale/ "Ep 40 - Cost Averaging") / [Blog](https://nononsenseforex.com/uncategorized/reverse-labouchere/ "Ep 40 - Blog")
### Should I use Dollar Cost Averaging or Martingale in FX?
### Answer: *Holy shit, NO!*
*   Used in **Stocks** and sometimes make sense. Since stocks have an **intrinsic value**, you
    don't expect them to fall further and further.
*   This doesn't apply to **FX** at all, since your trades are **relative values**!


## [MM 13](https://youtu.be/Bsc_1GwKINM "Trailing Stops - YouTube") / - - -
### Trailing Stops (TS) In Forex
*   Is something **VP almost never has to do**! *(t = 2:40)*
*   Gives **prequisites** for **entering**, what **numbers** to use and how to **maintain** TS.
*   You **don't** want the price to **hit** the TS. Don't have it to tight, like **regular SL**.
*   **Place** a TS when: *(t = 7:40)*
    * price has ***closed*** *>= 2 x ATR* from **entry point**.
    * For e.g. ATR = 100 p, price goes up 100 p, take 50% off. If price >= 200 p up, place TS.
*   **Numbers** are: *(t = 8:35)*
    * TS goes *1.5 x ATR* **behind** price.
*   **Maintaining** rules are: *(t = 9:05)*, *(t = 9:30)*, *(t = 10:20)*
    * more **important** than the **numbers** above, they may be **adjusted**.
    * VP uses the **same ATR** as when he **entered** the trade. *(t = 10:50)*
    * VP **demonstrates** setting the TS based on 1.5 x ATR (going short, ATR sits above price)
    *(t = 16:10)*
    * In order to **maintain** it **manually**, VP checks only **once a day**. *(t = 18:00)*
    * **Leave it** unless price has **closed** for even **more** pips. *(t = 19:40)*
    * The TS **never** moves **backward**! Only further in the direction you already moved it.
      *(t = 20:55)*
    * Always keep it *1.5 x ATR* away. *(t = 21:55)*


## [MM 14 (Podcast Ep 72)](https://nononsenseforex.podbean.com/e/ep72-a-common-mistake/ "Ep 72 - Risk Split") / [Blog](https://nononsenseforex.com/forex-q-and-a-podcast/dont-split-your-risk/ "Ep 72 - Blog")
### Don't Split Your Risk (cutting profits in half)
*   *Blog & Podcast:* VP advises to **split** money into **two accounts** at different 
    **brokers** and how it affects risk calculation. *(t = 16:15)*
*   This episode can be seen as a **supplement** to the **risk** video
    [MM 3](https://youtu.be/bqWLFNpK6eg "Risk - YouTube").
*   VP mentions **other markets** that had been introduced on his channel: **Metal, Oil, Index**.  
    Better **wait** until you're *inch wide, mile deep* into FX before moving on to other markets.
    *(t = 2:00)*  
*   *Blog:* But VP shows in the [Indices video](https://youtu.be/RDRg3ATK1UM) how powerful it is to 
    become proficient at **multiple markets** and how **Curry Wurst** could upset
    **David Hasselhoff**.
*   *Index example:* An annual **return** of **10 %** in
    **FX, metal, indices** + **1.5 %** in **Oil**, gives a realistic return of **31.5 %**.  
    How to calculate risk? *(t = 7:30)*
*   Let's **split 20k** into **10k** in **FX** on **Broker A** and **10k** in **metals** on
    **Broker B**. *(t = 9:20)*  
    The **risk** is still **20k**! Trade the **same** way as it was **all** in **one** account.
    Always take the **risk** off of the **sum**.  
    *Blog:* Even if you have only **one trade** open in one of the two accounts. *(t = 10:50)*  
    Hence the **2% risk** in the **10k FX** account is not 200$ but **400 $**. *(t = 12:00)*
*   Treating the accounts **seperately** would yield a total return of **only 10 %** - not **20 %**!  
    Spilttig your risk also **splits** your **returns**! *(t = 13:50)*
*   **Leverage** should be **adjusted** - in this scenario only - from **20:1** to 30:1
    (or **40:1** if possible). *(t = 15:05)*
*   **Try** this method in **demo** to get used to it before trading real money. *(t = 16:45)*
*   *Blog:* If you **lose** in one market, you may **compensate** in another.
