The preparation of this papers resulted from the need to take personal notes while studying the NNF material. It deals only with content from the perspective of a fully **algorithmic approach** to the **FX indicator search** and **trading**. Therefore, the content written down is **selective**, as is the sample of videos and podcasts.
